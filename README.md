Movie Search App
A simple React-based application to search for movies using the TMDb (The Movie Database) API. The app allows users to search for movies, add custom movies to the list, and store the data in local storage.

Features
Search Movies: Enter a movie name in the search bar to fetch and display relevant results from TMDb.
Add Custom Movies: Add a movie manually to the list.
Local Storage: Added movies are stored in the browser's local storage and persist between sessions.
Clear Storage: Option to clear all stored data from local storage.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.


Usage
Search for a Movie: Type the name of a movie in the search bar to get a list of movies from TMDb.
Add a Custom Movie: After typing a movie name, click on the "Add Movie" button to add the movie to the list.
Clear Local Storage: Click on the "Remove" button to clear all movies from local storage.
API Integration
This app uses the TMDb API to fetch movie data. You'll need an API key from TMDb to access their database.

Important: The app currently uses a hardcoded API key. In a production environment, it's crucial to keep API keys secure by using environment variables or a backend server.
